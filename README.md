# FTC Java introduction tutorial
This is a simple Java project to help explain some programming concepts for help with FTC software

## Intended Audience

Learners starting a FTC project and starting to learn about Java programming

## Contribute

Please feel free to add and improve to this project to teach new Learners about Java programming and how it fits into an FTC Robot

## Before you start (We assume you have downloaded and installed ```git```, ```JDK1.8``` and ```netbeans 8.2 or later```)

### Steps to get the project on your computer

1. Go to ```https://github.com``` and create an Account.
2. Browse to the Project ```https://github.com/mtbbiker/ftcrobottutorial``` and ```Fork``` your own copy
3. Create a directory on your computer where you want to create your coding project. Use your favourite git application or Terminal to clone the project to your Computer
4. If you use a Terminal ```(git alread installed)``` Type ```$ git clone https://github.com/yourusername/ftcrobottutorial.git```
5. Once the project is cloned, Open Netbeans and Open the project. 

### Software Development Concepts

The following ideas are discussed in a class to create a basic background and create some understanding of how it all fits together

1. Computer Concepts: (Networking, RAM, CPU, Interfaces and inter communication channels (wifi, ethernet etc))
2. A software program (Objects, Classes, properties, Events, threading) 
3. Tools: Git, Development IDE (i.e Netbeans, IntelliJ)
4. Development Life cycle (Design, Model, Implement, Test, Deploy) ...start again (Iterative)
5. The Robot and its sensors and how it all fits together
